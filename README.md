# Research Hub

A clean, fast static site to browse research reports generated by the OpenClaw research agent.

## Tech Stack

- Next.js 15 (App Router)
- React 19
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Vercel (deployment)

## Features

- List of research reports with dates, titles, excerpts
- Individual report pages with markdown rendering
- Dark/light mode (via system preference)
- Search (coming soon)

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000

## Deployment

This project is optimized for Vercel. Connect your repo and deploy with one click.

```bash
quick vercel link
quick vercel deploy --prod
```

## Data Source

The app reads markdown files from the `research/` directory of the main OpenClaw workspace. In production, you can either:
- Copy research files into the app repo (simplest)
- Fetch from a remote JSON API (more dynamic)

For now, we copy files during build via a script.
