## Executive Summary

Addresses watchlist gap **2B. EU AI Act Enforcement Priorities** (🟡 MEDIUM). This report summarizes the enforcement framework, fine structures, and implementation timeline for the EU AI Act as of early 2026.

### Key Enforcement Parameters

| Violation Type | Max Fine | Max % Global Turnover |
|----------------|----------|----------------------|
| **Forbidden AI practices** (Art. 5) | €35 million | 7% |
| **Non-compliance** (provider/deployer duties, Art. 16–26, 50) | €15 million | 3% |
| **GPAI model violations** (documentation, transparency, access) | €15 million | 3% |
| **Misleading information** to authorities | €7.5 million | 1% |

- **SMEs/startups**: Fines capped at lower of amount or percentage
- **Enforcement start**: GPAI rules apply from Aug 2, 2025; fines from Aug 2, 2026
- **Member State obligations**: Define penalty rules and notify Commission by application date; annual reporting on fines issued

### What's Being Enforced?

1. **High‑risk AI systems** (Annex III): biometric identification, critical infrastructure, education, employment, law enforcement, etc.
2. **General‑purpose AI (GPAI) models**: transparency, copyright compliance, documentation, technical specifications
3. **Limited‑risk AI**: transparency obligations (e.g., chatbots must disclose AI nature)
4. **Unacceptable‑risk AI**: outright bans (social scoring, manipulative techniques, real‑time remote biometric identification in public spaces with narrow exceptions)

### Implementation Status (Early 2026)

- **Phased rollout** from Aug 2024 through 2026–2027
- Member States still transposing rules into national law; some delays reported
- European Commission issued guidelines under Article 96 to harmonize penalty approaches
- AI Office established to oversee GPAI model enforcement
- First enforcement actions expected in late 2026 once national competent authorities are fully operational

### Practical Implications for Enterprises

- **Due diligence**: Document AI system classifications, risk assessments, conformity assessments
- **Compliance programs**: appoint responsible personnel, maintain technical documentation, implement human oversight
- **GPAI providers**: Prepare for detailed documentation, copyright policies, and cooperation with the AI Office
- **Fines are real**: Up to 7% of global turnover is material even for large tech firms
- **SME relief**: Smaller players face proportionate penalties but must still comply

## 1. Penalty Structure Deep Dive

### Article 99: Core Fines

1. **Forbidden practices** (Art. 5): Highest penalty — reflects societal risk
   - Examples: manipulative AI, social scoring, untargeted facial recognition databases
2. **Provider/Deployer obligations** (Art. 16, 22–24, 26, 31, 33–34, 50): Mid‑tier
   - Includes data governance, transparency, accuracy, security, human oversight
3. **GPAI model violations** (Art. 51–55): Specific to foundation model providers
   - Must provide detailed technical info, comply with EU copyright law, enable evaluations
4. **Incorrect/misleading information**: Up to €7.5M or 1% turnover
   - Applies when providing false data to notified bodies or authorities

### Mitigating Factors (Recital 99 considerations)

- Nature, gravity, duration of infringement
- Number of affected persons and damage level
- Operator size and market share
- Coop eration with authorities
- Intentional vs negligent
- Steps taken to mitigate harm

SMEs receive statutory caps at lower of absolute amount or percentage.

## 2. Enforcement Timeline

| Date | Milestone |
|------|-----------|
| Aug 1, 2024 | Act enters into force |
| Feb 2025 | Prohibitions on unacceptable-risk AI apply |
| Aug 2, 2025 | GPAI model obligations (transparency, copyright, etc.) take effect |
| Aug 2, 2026 | GPAI‑specific fines (Art. 101) become enforceable |
| 2026–2027 | High‑risk AI system obligations phased in by category |
| Ongoing | Member States establish market surveillance authorities, define national penalties |

---

## 3. National Implementation

Each Member State must:
- Designate competent authorities (market surveillance, data protection)
- Lay down penalty rules (effective, proportionate, dissuasive)
- Notify Commission of rules by implementation deadline
- Report annually on fines imposed and related litigation

This leads to potential **variation** across the EU in enforcement aggressiveness and fine amounts.

---

## 4. Strategic Outlook

- **First high‑profile cases** likely target GPAI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.) for transparency/copyright compliance
- **High‑risk sectors** (healthcare, law enforcement, critical infrastructure) will see increased audits
- **Supply chain due diligence**: companies using third‑party AI systems must verify provider compliance
- **Conformity assessments**: mandatory for high‑risk systems; providers must affix CE marking

---

## 5. Data Gaps

- **Actual enforcement actions**: None yet reported (as of Feb 2026); need to monitor 2026–2027
- **National penalty variations**: Member States may set different fine scales within EU ranges
- **AI Office staffing**: Resource levels will determine enforcement capacity
- **Interpretation of "high‑risk"**: which specific AI systems are being prioritized?
