## 📈 Open‑Source LLM Pricing — February 2026 Update

### Key Trend: Mixed Movement

While the overarching trend remains **cost reduction**, February 2026 shows **divergent pricing strategies**:

- **108 out of 300 tracked models** experienced price changes in February (pricepertoken.com)
- Most changes are **decreases**, reinforcing the cost‑collapse narrative
- However, **some Chinese models are increasing** due to rising costs and demand

### Notable Increases

- **Zhipu GLM‑5**: +30% price hike (first increase in 2026)  
  *Driver*: Rising compute costs and surging demand in China (TrendForce, Feb 16)

### Upcoming Launches

- **DeepSeek V4**: Expected mid‑February 2026 (announced via Anue, TrendForce)  
  Likely to push performance‑cost frontier further; pricing to be announced.

### Efficiency Gains Continue

- Reasoning models (OpenAI o1, DeepSeek‑R1) trade speed for accuracy but still deliver GPT‑4‑level performance at **dramatically lower costs** (LLM‑Stats, 7h ago)
- Multimodal capabilities now standard across frontier models, without proportional cost increase

## 🧭 Impact on Gap #1B (Open‑Source Cost‑Performance Trajectories)

**Status**: 🔄 **Active Monitoring Required**

The February data confirms that **cost trajectories are not monolithic**:
- Western open models (Llama, Mistral) continue downward pressure
- Chinese models (Zhipu, later DeepSeek) may exhibit price volatility based on domestic factors
- Need **automated tracking** to capture these dynamics in real time

**Recommendation**: Implement the leaderboard‑tracking bot proposed in `research/2026-02-16-research-status-update.md` to monitor monthly price changes and score improvements across key providers.
