## 🔍 Topics Scanned

1. **AI Code Generation Impact (2026)**
   - Productivity gains vary widely: some studies report 25–90% speedups for simple/structured tasks
   - Counterpoint: METR (July 2025) randomized trial shows 19% slower completion with AI for experienced open-source devs
   - ~41% of code in real workflows now AI-generated
   - Synthesis: Productivity gains exist but depend on task type, developer experience, and process integration

2. **Agriculture Robotics & Precision Farming (2026)**
   - Equipment industry shifting to automation, precision tech, data-driven decisions
   - Task-specific robots: e.g., AllyNav Aries300N (orchards), Taurus series (field maintenance)
   - IoT + AI scouting + variable-rate systems + autonomous robots becoming integrated stack
   - Financing models (equipment/irrigation financing) helping adoption
   - Outlook: 2026 sees deeper integration of robotics with broader AgTech systems

3. **Satellite Internet Competition (Starlink vs others)**
   - Amazon Kuiper (LEO) expected to begin commercial service in 2026, raising potential "duopoly" scenario
   - Telesat Lightspeed targeting business-critical markets with guaranteed performance as premium alternative
   - Starlink >10 million customers worldwide (Feb 2026); price reductions announced to counter competition
   - Latency remains Starlink's key advantage over many competitors
