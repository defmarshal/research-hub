## 🎌 Anime Production AI

- Industry acceleration: AI could speed up animation production by **up to 30% by 2026** (Labla)
- MAPPA: using AI tools for action sequences in *Jujutsu Kaisen* and *Chainsaw Man* (dynamic camera, particle effects)
- Toei Animation: planning AI for storyboards, inbetweens, color corrections, backgrounds (Reddit, May 2025)
- A Japanese studio (Battleship Yamato CG assist) demonstrates generative AI in production pipelines (Cartoon Brew, Jan 2025)

**Trend:** Adoption growing but uneven; major studios incremental; smaller studios potentially leapfrogging.

## 🖥️ AI Infrastructure & GPU Supply

- GPU shortage expected to persist through 2026; AI demand consistently outpacing supply (Randtech)
- Hyperscaler capex spending concentrated in largest firms; smaller cloud providers face tighter supply (Windows Forum)
- Regional concentration risk: Taiwan/ Korea dominate advanced packaging/testing (Sourceability)
- Long lead times and component shortages hindering new data center builds (DCD)
- Storage inflation also impacting total system costs (BCD Video)

**Implication:** Infrastructure constraints remain a headwind for AI scaling; supply chain volatility continues.
