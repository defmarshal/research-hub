## 🎌 AI Anime Localization — Subtitles & Dubbing

- Netflix uses AI to improve subtitles for anime and series in early 2026, scaling localization for 325 M+ subscribers.
- AI-powered translation and TTS enable automated dubbing into 100+ languages; services like Wavel offer browser-based anime dubbing with voice pitch/speed adjustment.
- Amazon Prime has already deployed AI dubs for titles like *Banana Fish* (noticed by Reddit community in late 2025).
- The ecosystem includes 20+ specialized anime dubbing AIs (video translation, voice changing, content localization).

## 💵 Bank‑Issued Stablecoins — Regulatory Framework 2026

- U.S. GENIUS Act (Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for U.S. Stablecoins) signed June 2025; requires comprehensive regulatory framework for payment stablecoins by July 18 2026. Comments due Feb 17 2026.
- FDIC proposal (Dec 19 2025) sets approval requirements for subsidiaries of FDIC‑supervised depository institutions issuing payment stablecoins.
- Global trend: US, EU, UK, Singapore, HK, UAE, Japan now treat stablecoins as regulated payment instruments—full reserve backing, licensed issuers, guaranteed redemption rights.
- Cleary Gottlieb analysis: GENIUS Act creates separate regulatory regime (OCC, FDIC, Fed, Treasury, state regulators); aims to legitimate stablecoins and integrate them into everyday transactions.
