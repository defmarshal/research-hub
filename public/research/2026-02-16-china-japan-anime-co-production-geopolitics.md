## Executive Summary

Addresses watchlist gap **2C. China-Japan Co-Production Shifts** (🟡 MEDIUM priority). This report examines recent diplomatic tensions, regulatory barriers, and co‑production initiatives affecting anime market access between China and Japan.

### Key Findings

**Diplomatic Push vs Regulatory Reality:**
- China and Japan governments **agreed to prioritize** the Japan‑China Memorandum of Understanding on Co‑Production of Audiovisual Works (Dec 2024 foreign ministers meeting)
- Yet simultaneously, **China Film Administration froze approvals** of new Japanese movies (Nov 2025) and postponed at least six previously approved titles
- **Paradox**: Political will for co‑production exists, but implementation remains mired in opacity and protectionism

**Historical Context:**
- 2018 Japan‑China Film Co‑production Agreement existed, but **as of 2023, zero films produced** under it
- Chinese animation market grew to **3.5B yuan** while Japanese imports peaked in 2018 then declined sharply post‑2019
- April 2021: NRTA extended mandatory pre‑approval to online streaming → killed simulcasts → piracy surge

**Current Barriers:**
- Opaque review process (NRTA can take up to 50 days; decisions unpredictable)
- Foreign content quotas on TV and streaming platforms
- Self‑review eliminated → all anime requires government approval before release
- Piracy remains rampant despite CODA‑China collaborations (B9GOOD case: 300M accesses, 45,000 videos)

**Recent Positive Signals:**
- Anti‑piracy cooperation improving (first successful cross‑border prosecution 2024)
- Both sides committed to "transparency of regulations" and "secure creative environment"
- Existing partnerships: Aniplex/Tencent, Bilibili investments in Japanese anime (Sony shares)

## 2. Market Impact

### Chinese Animation Market Growth (Domestic)

- Value reached **3.5B yuan** (JETRO, iResearch)
- Protectionist policies (foreign content quotas) artificially boosted domestic production
- TV and streaming limits: percentage caps on foreign vs domestic animation

### Japanese Anime Imports to China

- **2017**: >80% of Japanese TV anime available on Chinese streaming services
- **2018–2019**: Peak import value
- **Post‑2019**: Steep decline (see JETRO chart in full report)
- 2025: Freeze on new Japanese movie approvals signals further tightening

### Revenue Implications

- Co‑production under the 2018 agreement would exempt works from foreign film quotas → huge financial advantage
- But zero productions realized indicates agreement is **non‑functional** due to trust deficit and regulatory opacity

---

## 3. Geopolitical Risk Assessment

**Tension Drivers:**
- Political disputes (historical issues, territorial claims) spill into cultural domains
- China's "dual circulation" policy emphasizes domestic content, reducing reliance on Japanese IP
- National security framing of foreign media → increased scrutiny

**Opportunities:**
- Government‑to‑government dialogue (High‑Level People‑to‑People and Cultural Exchange Dialogue)
- Anti‑piracy collaboration shows practical cooperation possible
- Both sides benefit from Japanese creative talent + Chinese capital/market

**Risk Level:** 🟡 **ELEVATED** — unpredictable regulatory actions can shut down market access overnight; studios must diversify away from China dependence

---

## 4. Strategic Implications for Anime Stakeholders

- **Do not rely** on China as primary revenue source; quotas and approvals can change arbitrarily
- **Co‑production** remains theoretically attractive but practically elusive; requires deep local partnerships and political navigation
- **Piracy mitigation**: Invest in legal alternatives; Chinese audiences still hungry for Japanese anime but official channels are slow
- **Monitor**: NRTA announcement flow; Japan‑China MOU signing status; actual co‑production announcements (if any)

---

## 5. Data Gaps & Next Steps

- **Concrete co‑production examples**: None found under 2018 agreement; need to investigate why
- **Revenue numbers**: How much Japanese studios lost from China market post‑2021? Estimates needed
- **Streaming platform strategies**: Bilibili, Tencent, iQiyi licensing trends post‑2023
- **Fan sentiment**: Chinese audience attitudes toward Japanese content amid tensions
