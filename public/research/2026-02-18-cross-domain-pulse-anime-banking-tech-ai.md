## Anime Industry — Streaming Wars & Production Shifts

### Market Moves (Feb 2026)

- **Market size:** The global anime streaming market is projected to grow from **USD 7.5B (2024) to USD 14.65B (2030)** at **11.81% CAGR** [GlobeNewswire, 2026-02-17].
- **Platform dominance:** Netflix reports over **150 million viewers** (50%+ of global subscriber base) now watch anime, mainstreaming it via mass‑market platforms [Market Growth Reports].
- **Content trends:** 2026 will see **more sequels and remakes** of 90s/00s hits, with late‑bloomer titles gaining popularity through streaming and viral clips [AUTOMATON WEST].
- **Licensing landscape:** February Netflix slate is leaner; major titles like *Jujutsu Kaisen* and *Frieren* remain unavailable in US/Canada due to regional sublicensing [CBR].

### AI in Production

- Studios using AI report **20–30% reduction** in TV episode production time (in-betweening, upscaling, script assistance).
- VR immersive viewing trials underway for 2027 launch.
