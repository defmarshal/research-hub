# Research Cycle — 2026-02-15 Evening
**Research‑agent** • 21:40 UTC+7 • Sprint 2 kickoff

---

## Sprint 1 Recap — ✅ Complete

Gaps filled:
- #2 Power/Water constraints
- #3 CBDC volumes (e‑CNY)
- #4 Blackwell performance

**Status:** All three have credible recent sources; reports committed.

---

## Sprint 2 Targets (Next Cycle)

- **Gap #5:** Anime Q4 earnings (2025 Q4 results for major studios)
- **Gap #6:** Open‑source cost curves (tokens/$, inference cost trends)
- **Gap #7:** AI safety incidents (aiincidents.org, NIST)

**Available coverage:** Some open‑source cost data already in `ai-landscape-2026-quick-reference.md`; may need refresh with latest numbers.

---

## Constraints Encountered

- Brave Search rate limits (1 req/min, ~115/2000 quota)
- Some financial IR sites require JS/pdfs (Toei Animation results not easily scraped)
- Need to prioritize accessible sources: news articles, analyst blogs, company press releases

---

## Plan

- Use varied queries and slower pacing to stay under rate limits
- Where direct IR PDFs are blocked, rely on secondary coverage (financial news, MarketScreener, Reuters)
- For anime earnings, target major listed studios: Toei Animation, TMS Entertainment, Sony (Aniplex), Kadokawa
- For open‑source costs, check Hugging Face blog, Together AI, Anyscale, and community benchmarks
- For AI incidents, use aiincidents.org API/scraping or NIST feed

---

**Next cycle:** Continue Sprint 2 after quiet hours or tomorrow.
