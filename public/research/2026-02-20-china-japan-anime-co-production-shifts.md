## Executive Summary

Despite **government-level diplomacy** encouraging deeper China-Japan anime co-productions, **regulatory friction** on the Chinese side has created a volatile environment. Recent developments show both acceleration of joint projects and sudden freezes, indicating high geopolitical risk for studios and platforms relying on Chinese revenue.

Key findings:

- **Diplomatic push**: Dec 2024, China and Japan agreed to prioritize a Japan-China Memorandum of Understanding on audiovisual co‑productions, aiming to “promote cooperation based on the Japan-China Film Co‑production Agreement” and create “an environment in which creators in both countries can engage in creative activities with a sense of security.”
- **Concrete deals**: Fuji TV, bilibili, and Tokai Television announced a three‑company live‑action drama co‑production (Link Click) scheduled April 2026; multiple global projects in pipeline.
- **Regulatory freeze**: As of Nov 2025, China Film Administration froze approvals of new Japanese movies and postponed indefinitely at least six previously approved titles.
- **Partnership precedent**: Bilibili and Funimation (now Sony) have a pre‑existing strategic alliance for joint licensing in US and China, showing platform-level cooperation remains possible despite state-level tensions.

**Conclusion**: Co‑production momentum exists at the corporate and government‑dialogue levels, but Chinese regulatory unpredictability poses a material risk to revenue streams and production plans. Studios should diversify distribution and include force‑majeure clauses for China market access.

## 1. Government-Level Initiatives

### Second Japan-China High-Level People-to-People and Cultural Exchange Dialogue (Dec 25, 2024)

Foreign ministers Takeshi Iwaya (Japan) and Wang Yi (China) met and reached **10 agreements** to develop closer cultural ties. Notably:

- They agreed to **prioritize signing** the Japan‑China Memorandum of Understanding on co‑production of audiovisual works.
- The MOU is framed as a “means of promoting co‑production of image work such as animation, drama and documentary films for broadcasting and distribution.”
- Both sides committed to:
  - Resolve transparency on Japanese works (anime, games) released in China
  - Strengthen anti‑piracy measures
  - Create a secure creative environment
  - Promote cooperation under the existing 2018 Japan‑China Film Co‑production Agreement

The 2018 agreement already allows co‑productions to receive preferential treatment (e.g., easier release, revenue share) in both countries. The new MOU aims to accelerate this pipeline.

## 2. Corporate Deals in Motion

### Fuji TV × bilibili × Tokai Television (Link Click Live‑Action)

- **Project**: Live‑action drama adaptation of the popular Chinese animated series *Link Click* (2021, 850M views on bilibili).
- **Structure**: Three‑company co‑production; Fuji TV (broadcaster), bilibili (Chinese platform/IP holder), Tokai Television (regional terrestrial broadcaster).
- **Schedule**: Airing nationwide in Tokai Television’s Saturday drama slot starting April 11, 2026; subsequent distribution on Fuji TV’s OTT platforms (FOD, TVer).
- **Significance**: First internationally co‑produced terrestrial drama for Fuji TV; showcases IP utilization across borders.
- **Background**: Fuji TV and bilibili established strategic partnership in Sept 2023, aiming for program sales, rights distribution, co‑productions, and joint IP development. In Oct 2023, Fuji TV launched “B8station” anime block airing Chinese‑produced anime (starting with Link Click). The Link Click live‑action is the first major co‑production fruit from this partnership.

### Additional Projects

- Fuji TV also mentioned: “the first jointly developed TV anime between the two companies, *Tomb Raider King*, is scheduled to be broadcast” in July 2026, with multiple global projects in collaboration with bilibili.
- These indicate a broadening pipeline beyond single‑title adaptations.

## 3. Platform‑Level Alliances

### Bilibili × Funimation (Sony)

- **Announcement**: March 2019 (still active in spirit)
- **Terms**: Joint licensing of anime for United States and China markets; mutual provision of licensed titles.
- **Rationale**: First strategic alliance between content providers in China and the US, reducing licensing friction and ensuring curated catalog access.

While older, this partnership set the template for cross‑border collaboration and remains relevant as Bilibili continues to expand globally.

## 4. Regulatory Headwinds in China

### Freeze on Japanese Movie Approvals (Nov 2025)

According to *The Japan Times* (Nov 27, 2025):

- **China Film Administration has frozen approvals** of new Japanese movies.
- At least six titles that had previously been approved have had their releases **postponed indefinitely**.

This regulatory clampdown contrasts sharply with the diplomatic push for co‑production, suggesting that **political tensions can surface abruptly in content approvals**, independent of formal agreements.

### Impact

- Japanese film/TV exporters face **unpredictable market access**.
- Co‑productions designed to qualify for easier release may still be subject to political whims.
- Risk is **non‑commercial**: decisions likely stem from diplomatic rather than content‑based criteria.

## 5. Synthesis and Implications

### Dual Trajectories

| Dimension | Trend | Evidence |
|-----------|-------|----------|
| **Diplomatic** | Warming, structured cooperation | Dec 2024 high‑level dialogue, MOU priority, 10 agreements |
| **Corporate** | Accelerating partnerships | Fuji TV–bilibili multi‑project pipeline; Bilibili–Funimation alliance |
| **Regulatory** | Frosty, unpredictable | Nov 2025 freeze on Japanese film approvals; indefinite delays |

The **regulatory environment remains the bottleneck**. Even as governments talk cooperation and companies sign deals, Chinese administrative bodies can stall or block releases without transparent rationale.

### Risk Assessment for Anime Stakeholders

- **Revenue risk**: China is a massive market (Bilibili alone has 300M+ users). A regulatory freeze directly impacts projected returns on co‑production investments.
- **Production risk**: Co‑production deals tied to Chinese partners may become **unfinancable** if release certainty is below ~70%.
- **Geopolitical risk**: Future diplomatic incidents could trigger similar freezes without warning.

### Recommended Mitigations

1. **Diversify distribution**: Do not rely on China as primary revenue source for co‑productions; secure multi‑territory presales before greenlight.
2. **Contractual safeguards**: Include force‑majeure clauses specifically addressing China regulatory approvals; consider staged financing contingent on release windows.
3. **Government diplomacy**: Advocate through industry bodies (e.g., Joint Anime Association) to elevate co‑production MOU to a **binding treaty** with dispute resolution provisions.
4. **Alternative markets**: Strengthen Southeast Asia (Indonesia, Thailand), South Asia (India), and Western partnerships to offset China volatility.

## 6. Monitoring Plan

- **Regulatory**: Track China Film Administration announcements and SARFT notices; watch for shifts in “foreign content quotas” and approval timelines.
- **Diplomatic**: Monitor Japan-China cultural exchange committee meetings; any escalation or de‑escalation.
- **Corporate**: Follow bilibili’s quarterly earnings calls and partnership announcements; note changes in co‑production budgets.
- **Market data**: Track revenue recognition from China for major Japanese studios (e.g., Aniplex, Kadokawa) as an indirect signal of market openness.
