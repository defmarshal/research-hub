## 🔍 Topics Scanned

1. **AI in Anime Production (Cost Trends)**
   - AI tools now handle in-betweening, reducing labor costs dramatically
   - “Post‑production waste” reduction: AI enables “production elasticity” — studios can pivot without budget crises
   - Human oversight still essential for quality control and copyright, but workforce shrinks
   - Early‑adopter studios report 15%+ cost savings; sound design and music also being augmented
   - Integration strategy matters: choose tools that match studio “on‑model” style

2. **Edge AI Chips & Sensors (2026)**
   - Edge AI shifting from niche to default in IoT sensors/modules/gateways by 2026
   - Chipmakers: Hailo‑8 (26 TOPS, 2.5–3 W), SiMa.ai MLSoC (sub‑5W), Synaptics showcasing AI‑native sensing at CES 2026
   - RISC‑V and chiplet‑based designs gaining traction; AI‑enabled design tools accelerate development
   - Key use: energy‑autonomous sensors, real‑time pattern recognition, event‑driven systems
   - Market growth driven by smart home, industrial automation, and embedded vision

3. **Bank‑Issued Stablecoins Adoption (2026)**
   - Regulatory clarity (US GENIUS Act, EU MiCA) accelerating bank participation
   - CFTC guidance allows bank‑issued payment stablecoins as customer margin collateral
   - Movement from pilots to platforms: FIDD (Fidelity), European banking consortium euro‑stablecoin, VersaBank custody, Goldman Sachs emerging‑markets use cases
   - 2026 focus: integration, orchestration, production‑scale deployment (corporate, cross‑border, treasury)
   - Consumer‑scale CBDCs still likely beyond 2026 in major markets
