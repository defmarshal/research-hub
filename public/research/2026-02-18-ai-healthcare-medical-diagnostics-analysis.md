## 2. AI in Medical Imaging & Radiology

### 2.1 FDA Approval Surge

- **Total AI/ML devices:** 950 (as of June 2024)
- **Radiology devices:** 723 (76% of total)
- **Approval trend:**
  - 1995–2015: 33 devices (3%)
  - 2023 alone: 221 devices (23%)
- **Pathway:** 97% cleared via 510(k) (substantial equivalence) — faster but does not require independent clinical data
- **Testing gaps (critical):**
  - Only 33/717 (5%) underwent prospective testing
  - Only 56 (8%) included human‑in‑the‑loop testing
  - Only 208 (29%) incorporated clinical testing
  - Only 15 devices had both prospective + clinical testing; 6 had all three
- **Total radiology AI tools approved (including 2025 updates):** ~1,039 (Radiology Business)

**Implication:** Most AI tools are not rigorously validated for clinical performance; hospitals must do their own assessment.

### 2.2 Leading Vendors

- GE Healthcare: 96 cleared tools
- Siemens Healthineers: 80
- Philips: 42
- Canon: 35
- United Imaging: 32
- Aidoc: 30

### 2.3 Clinical Applications & Performance

**Use cases:**
- Image interpretation: flagging cancers in mammograms, lung nodules, strokes
- Workflow triage: prioritizing urgent cases (e.g., Viz.ai for stroke)
- Report drafting: automated preliminary findings

**Performance examples:**
- GPT‑4V achieved 61% accuracy on a 936‑case diagnostic challenge vs physicians 49%
- GPT‑4V identified MS brain MRI progression with 85% accuracy
- Viz.ai reduced time‑to‑treatment for stroke by 66 minutes
- Breast cancer risk model (MIT Mirai) improves early detection

### 2.4 Adoption Metrics

- **Europe:** 48% of radiologists actively using AI in 2024 (up from 20% in 2018) — survey
- **USA:** ~2% of practices using AI (AP News) — suggests slower adoption due to skepticism, reimbursement, liability concerns
- **Overall:** >2/3 of physicians report using AI tools in some form (though “use” may include non‑diagnostic assistants)

### 2.5 Regulatory & Liability Challenges

- **FDA:** Historically places implementation responsibility on manufacturers and end users. TPLC framework moves toward continuous oversight of AI updates.
- **EU AI Act:** Classifies radiology AI as high‑risk → mandatory requirements for training data curation, bias checks, human oversight, documentation.
- **Liability:** Unclear who is responsible when AI makes an error — manufacturer, hospital, or clinician?
- **Explainability:** Black‑box models hinder trust; XAI needed for clinical acceptance.
- **Radiologist education:** ~80% of radiologists report unfamiliarity with medical‑device regulations for AI — major training gap.

### 5.3 Liability Questions

- Who is liable if an AI‑assisted diagnosis is wrong? The clinician who relied on it, the hospital that deployed it, or the vendor that sold it?
- Courts will shape standards; early cases will set precedents

### 5.4 Reimbursement

- Payers (insurance, Medicare) developing coverage policies for AI‑assisted procedures
- Reimbursement codes (CPT) emerging for AI‑enabled services
- Value‑based care ties payment to outcomes — AI must demonstrate clinical utility

- Interoperability standards (HL7 FHIR, DICOM) essential

### 6.2 Change Management & Training

- Radiology education gap: 80% unfamiliar with AI device regulations
- Need for continuing medical education (CME) on AI fundamentals
- Addressing fear of replacement; positioning AI as augmentation

### 6.3 Performance & Generalizability

- AI models trained on limited populations may fail on diverse real‑world data
- FDA review found many devices lacking diverse testing cohorts
- Institutions must perform local validation before deployment

### 6.4 Cost & ROI

## 8. Conclusion

AI in healthcare has crossed the chasm from experimental to essential. In drug discovery, AI is delivering faster timelines, higher success rates, and lower costs — with the first approval imminent. In radiology, hundreds of AI tools are clearing regulatory hurdles, though validation gaps remain a concern. Clinical trials are being revolutionized by digital twins and AI‑driven design.

The common theme: **2026 is the year AI stops being optional**. Organizations that industrialize AI — integrating it into core workflows, building governance, and demonstrating clinical utility — will dominate. Those that hesitate risk falling behind as the industry re‑architects itself around intelligent systems.

The future of medicine is AI‑augmented, data‑driven, and personalized. The transformation is already underway.
