## ⚡ AI Infrastructure: Power Becomes Bottleneck

- Shift from compute‑centric to **power‑centric** constraints (Lexology)
- Companies competing for scarce grid capacity, long‑term PPAs, on‑site generation (Lexology)
- Data centers investing in on‑site power sources and autonomous operations for optimization (Data Center Knowledge)
- **Inference** moving closer to users; efficiency prioritized over sheer scale (Built In)
- Supply chain delays: transformers and high‑voltage equipment causing upgrade bottlenecks (Microsoft, Jan 2026)
- New transmission projects face 7–10 year timelines due to permitting (Microsoft)

**Implication:** AI growth now limited by energy infrastructure, not just GPUs. Location and power strategy are critical for deployments.
