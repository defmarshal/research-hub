## Executive Summary

Addressed 🔴 **HIGH** priority gap: *Which CBDCs are actually scaling (transaction volume, active users)? Interoperability progress? Bank profitability impact? Privacy backlash?*

**Key findings:**

- **Global landscape:** 137 countries exploring CBDCs (98% of global GDP); 49 pilot projects; 3 fully launched (Bahamas, Jamaica, Nigeria)
- **Scaling leaders:**
  - **e-CNY:** 7 trillion yuan ($986B) transaction volume (June 2024); 2.25 billion wallets — truly massive scale
  - **India e‑rupee:** ₹10.16B ($122M) in circulation (March 2025), +334% YoY; 1M retail transactions/day peak
  - **Nigeria eNaira:** 10M active users (2024), doubled from 5M (2023)
- **Interoperability:** Cross‑border wholesale projects doubled since Ukraine war (13 projects); mBridge (China/Thailand/UAE/HK/Saudi) now central‑bank‑managed
- **Privacy backlash:** US opposition high (74% oppose government spending control); 68% oppose transaction tracking
- **Bank impact:** Deposit disintermediation risk theoretical but not yet materialized; most pilots involve banks

**Implication:** CBDC surge is real among emerging markets; retail pilots dominate; cross‑border wholesale gaining momentum; US stands alone in halting retail work.

## 1. Global CBDC Adoption Landscape

### Exploration → Pilot → Launch Funnel

- **137 countries** (98% of global GDP) exploring CBDCs (Atlantic Council, July 2025) — up from 35 in May 2020
- **72 countries** in advanced phase (development, pilot, or launch)
- **49 pilot projects** worldwide — new high
- **3 fully launched** retail CBDCs: Bahamas (Sand Dollar), Jamaica, Nigeria (eNaira)

### Retail vs Wholesale Focus

- **70% of pilot programs** prioritize retail CBDCs over wholesale (CoinLaw, 2025)
- Wholesale cross‑border projects: **13** (up from 6 pre‑2022) — including Project mBridge, Project Helvetia III

## 2. Scaling CBDCs: Transaction Volumes & Active Users

### 🇨🇳 China e-CNY — The Clear Leader

| Metric | Value | Date |
|--------|-------|------|
| Transaction volume | ¥7 trillion (~$986B) | June 2024 |
| Growth | Nearly 4× from ¥1.8T (June 2023) | — |
| Wallets | 2.25 billion | Oct 2025 |
| Coverage | 17 provincial regions (education, healthcare, tourism) | — |

**Interpretation:** e-CNY is the only CBDC approaching meaningful scale. Multiple wallets per person suggest government‑driven adoption (China population 1.4B). Still pilot, but massive.

### 🇮🇳 India e‑Rupee — Rapid Growth

| Metric | Value | Date |
|--------|-------|------|
| Circulation value | ₹10.16B (~$122M) | March 2025 |
| YoY growth | +334% (from ₹2.34B in 2024) | — |
| Retail tx peak | 1 million/day | Dec 2023 |
| Retail tx later | 100,000/day average | mid‑2024 |
| Wholesale | ₹2.75B (~$33M) bond settlements on launch day | — |
| Offline/ programmable | Pilot features enabled | 2025 |

**Interpretation:** India is scaling fast, though absolute values still small relative to population. Daily retail tx volume dropped from peak, suggesting volatility.

### 🇳🇬 Nigeria eNaira — Solid User Base

| Metric | Value | Date |
|--------|-------|------|
| Active users | 10 million | 2024 |
| Growth | Doubled from 5M (2023) | — |
| Focus | Urban retail payments | — |

**Interpretation:** Nigeria leads Africa; user growth steady but transaction values not disclosed (likely low per‑user value).

### Others

- **Bahamas Sand Dollar:** Launched 2020, small population (~400k) — niche
- **Jamaica:** Launched 2022, limited data
- **Russia:** Digital ruble testing since 2022, expanding; use cases government‑focused
- **UAE:** Cross‑border digital dirham payment to China (AED 50M ≈ $13.6M) executed Jan 2024

---

## 3. Interoperability & Cross‑Border Progress

### Project mBridge

- **Participants:** China, Thailand, UAE, Hong Kong, Saudi Arabia
- **Status:** Now managed directly by participating central banks (no BIS involvement) — indicates maturity
- **Use case:** Cross‑border payments, reducing reliance on correspondent banks

### Project Helvetia III

- **Participants:** Switzerland, France
- **Status:** Extended June 2024 — wholesale CBDC trials for tokenized assets settlement

### SWIFT Trials

- Planned live trials for CBDC‑based transfers in 2025

**Takeaway:** Cross‑border wholesale CBDCs are accelerating, driven by desire to bypass dollar‑centric systems (and sanctions). Emerging markets benefit from cheaper remittance corridors.

---

## 4. Bank Profitability Impact: Not Yet Material

**Theoretical risk:** CBDCs could disintermediate banks by allowing citizens to deposit funds directly with central banks, reducing bank deposits and lending capacity.

**Reality so far:**
- Most pilots **involve commercial banks** for onboarding and distribution (India, Russia, Nigeria)
- No evidence of mass deposit flight yet
- Central banks maintain **wallet limits** (e-CNY caps) to prevent bank run
- Focus on **inclusion** and **payments efficiency**, not replacing banks

**Monitoring needed:** As CBDCs scale to >10% of money supply, deposit disintermediation could become acute. Currently negligible.

---

## 5. Privacy Backlash & Political Opposition

### US Exception

- **Executive order (2025):** President Trump halted all retail CBDC work — only country to do so
- **Public opinion (Cato Institute):**
  - 74% oppose if government can control spending
  - 68% oppose if government can track every purchase
  - 68% oppose if cash is abolished
  - 65% oppose if cyberattack risk increases
  - 64% oppose if government can impose punitive taxes
  - 59% oppose if government can freeze accounts of protesters

**Implication:** US political sentiment strongly anti‑retail‑CBDC, emphasizing privacy and liberty concerns. However, wholesale cross‑border work (Project Agorá) continues.

### Global Privacy Variations

- China: e‑CNY uses tiered wallet anonymity (limited balances)
- Europe: Digital euro design emphasizes privacy (face‑to‑face transactions offline, limited traceability)
- Nigeria: eNaira faces low public trust; adoption driven by government disbursements

## 6. Future Trajectory (2025–2031)

### Projected Growth

- Global CBDC transaction **count**: 307.1M (2024) → **7.8B (2031)** (Juniper Research)
- 90% of central banks exploring CBDCs in 2025
- 81% either have issued or plan to issue; 47% expect to launch within 5 years

### Key Catalysts

1. **Stablecoin competition:** US dollar‑backed stablecoins proliferating internationally → CBDCs as sovereign response
2. **Financial inclusion:** Emerging markets using CBDCs to reach unbanked
3. **Cross‑border efficiency:** mBridge and similar projects to cut remittance costs
4. **Programmability:** Features like India’s offline e‑rupee, smart contract‑enabled disbursements

---

## 7. Enterprise ROI Implications

### For Banks

- **Short‑term:** CBDCs are a platform shift, not an existential threat yet; participate in pilots to retain relevance
- **Medium‑term:** Monitor wallet limits relaxation; stress‑test deposit flight scenarios
- **Opportunity:** CBDC‑enabled services (custody, payments processing) could offset margin pressure

### For Fintechs

- **Integration opportunities:** Build wallets, KYC/AML layers, merchant acceptance tools
- **Cross‑border remittance:** Leverage mBridge for cheaper corridors (Asia‑Middle East)
- **Programmable money:** Develop conditional payment protocols for government disbursements

### For Corporates

- **Treasury management:** Prepare for CBDC settlement options in cross‑border trade
- **Compliance:** Adapt to CBDC‑based AML/CFT frameworks (more transparency than cash)

---

## 8. Data Gaps & Uncertainties

- **Transaction values vs counts:** Many reports give wallet counts but not economic volume (Nigeria, India retail) — hard to gauge economic significance
- **Bank profitability metrics:** No published data on how CBDC participation affects bank NIM or funding costs
- **Privacy acceptance thresholds:** Unknown what % of users will adopt CBDCs if full anonymity is compromised
- **Offline usage:** Limited data on how often offline CBDC features are used (critical for inclusion in low‑connectivity areas)
- **Interoperability ROI:** No cost‑benefit studies of mBridge vs traditional correspondent banking

---

## 9. Next Research Steps

1. **Deep dive on e‑CNY:** Get latest quarterly numbers (Q4 2025, Q1 2026) to verify acceleration trend
2. **Bank impact study:** Survey Indian/Nigerian banks on deposit trends and CBDC-related costs/benefits
3. **Cross‑border cost analysis:** Compare mBridge transaction costs vs SWIFT/golden‑rule for remittances
4. **Privacy trade‑off experiments:** Survey user willingness to adopt CBDCs under varying anonymity models
5. **Wholesale CBDC adoption:** Track which commercial banks are using Project Helvetia III, mBridge for settlement
