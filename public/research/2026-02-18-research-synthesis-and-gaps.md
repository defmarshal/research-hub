# Research Synthesis and Gaps — 2026-02-18

**Agent:** research-agent  
**Task:** Continuous coverage of anime, banking, tech, AI  
**Cycle:** Afternoon follow-up (12:17 UTC)  
**Web Search Status:** ⚠️ Brave API currently returning `SUBSCRIPTION_TOKEN_INVALID` (degraded)

---

## Executive Summary

Today's research output is robust: **12 detailed reports** covering AI sectors (agriculture, data centers, healthcare, manufacturing, open-source frameworks, LLM cost trajectories), anime streaming economics, autonomous systems updates, and three cross-domain pulse analyses. Coverage spans technical deep dives and industry news.

**Primary Gap:** Real-time news ingestion is impaired due to Brave Search API failure. The latest successful searches appear to be from early morning UTC; afternoon updates may be missing.

## Coverage Analysis

### Anime
- ✅ Streaming wars (Prime Video push, Netflix/WBD, Skydance/Paramount, Crunchyroll)
- ✅ AI production integration (20–30% time reduction)
- ✅ Market size and international share
- ⚠️ Missing: latest announcements (could be in news from past 6h)

### Banking / FinTech
- ✅ Agentic AI infrastructure (Monei + Scrub.io programmable wallets)
- ✅ Synthetic data for fraud training
- ✅ CBDC research coverage
- ⚠️ Could use: latest regulatory moves or major bank AI deployments this week

### Technology
- ✅ Neuromorphic computing (Intel Loihi 2)
- ✅ Edge AI and quantum infrastructure
- ✅ Shift to hybrid AI infra
- ⚠️ Could expand: cybersecurity AI trends, semiconductor supply chain

### AI / LLMs
- ✅ Qwen 3.5 open-source agentic model
- ✅ Reasoning and multimodal as enterprise standard
- ✅ Competitive landscape (Gemini 3, Claude 4, GPT-5.2)
- ⚠️ Missing: today’s papers from arXiv (new RL, agents, etc.)

## Cross-Domain Synthesis

All domains converge on **autonomy shift**: AI moving from assistive to autonomous agent execution. In anime, AI animates; banking, AI transacts; tech, AI controls; models, agents act. This trend is accelerating and warrants deeper tracking of agentic frameworks, safety, and regulation.

---

## Recommendations

1. **Restore search API key** or enable fallback provider (tavily/perplexity) to ensure freshness.
2. **Schedule hourly research checks** to catch breaking news during Asia business hours.
3. **Add arXiv CS recent papers** as a direct fetch target (bypass search) for AI updates.
4. **Monitor flash crashes or spikes** in token prices (crypto/AI tokens) as a leading indicator of market sentiment.

## Next Actions

- Re-run research-agent after API fix to capture late-day updates
- Consider expanding to geopolitics (US, China, EU AI policies) for domain completeness
