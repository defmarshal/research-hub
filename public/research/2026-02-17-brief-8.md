## 🎬 Anime Production Pipeline AI

- **Workflow integration**: AI tools now deeply embedded in anime production pipelines (Smartnet Academy)
- **Custom neural networks**: Leading studios training models on their own house style to preserve artistic signature rather than homogenizing output (Techlasi)
- **Generative AI impact**: Restructuring cost basis and recoupment speed — not just a technical evolution but a business model shift (Vitrina.ai)
- **Neural rendering**: ML predicts final frame output, reducing need for massive render farms; enables real-time high-fidelity visuals and faster creative iterations (Vitrina.ai)
- **Globalization**: Native-level viewing experiences for global audiences, increasing lifecycle revenue and marketability of regional assets (Vitrina.ai)
- **Studio examples**: K&K Design (Nagoya) using proprietary AI; MAPPA employing AI for action sequences

**Trend:** AI is moving from experimental to core infrastructure in anime production, with cost, speed, and global reach as key drivers.
