## 🎬 AI Model Licensing Trends — Anime Studios

- AI is accelerating animation production by 20–30% and reducing costs ~15% by 2026.
- Localization benefits: AI‑powered subtitling and automated dubbing cut time/cost for international distribution.
- Licensing landscape in 2026 emphasizes vertical‑specific mastery to avoid EBITDA leakage; rights management becoming more complex with AI‑generated content.
- Mainstream adoption: even traditional studios now embrace some form of AI assistance; independent creators gain faster iteration cycles.

## ⚡ Embedded AI Chips & Edge Computing — 2026

- Edge AI chip market features players like Hailo (Hailo-8: 26 TOPS at 2.5–3 W), SiMa.ai (MLSoC, sub-5W), and others targeting battery‑powered devices.
- 2026 trends: Edge SoCs, dedicated NPUs, and MCU‑class accelerators enabling high performance-per-watt for computer vision and analytics.
- Events: Embedded World 2026 (Nuremberg, March 10–12) will showcase latest edge AI platforms from Avalue, Advantech, etc.
- Applications: industrial IoT, robotics, smart cameras, privacy‑preserving video analytics (e.g., Hailo‑15 VPU for 4K30 with dynamic privacy masking).

## 💱 CBDCs & Cross‑Border Payments — 2026

- Cross‑border CBDC use cases show potential for cost/speed gains but bring legal and practical challenges greater than domestic use.
- Projects: mBridge (China, Hong Kong, SAR, Thailand, UAE, Saudi Arabia) for direct CBDC‑to‑CBDC payments; J.P. Morgan’s blockchain simulation with MAS and Banque de France for SGD/EUR CBDC transactions.
- Political dimension: U.S. national security concerns about losing visibility into cross‑border flows; Federal Reserve skepticism (“solution in search of a problem”).
- World Bank review draws lessons from Africa and other experiments; interoperability frameworks remain immature.
