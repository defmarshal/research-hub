## Key Findings

**AI Virtual Assistant ROI (2026):**
- 30–70% cost reduction, 60–80% query automation
- 3–6 month payback, $180k–$980k annual savings
- 54% of enterprises already using AI assistants
- Market: $10.7B → $49.9B (2023–2030, 24.9% CAGR)

**But production reality:**
- Apple Siri: 2‑year delay despite Google Gemini partnership
- Claude Opus 4.6: fails at simple brownfield jQuery migration
- Harvard study: AI intensifies workload instead of reducing it

**Synthesis:** Greenfield ROI is real, but brownfield integration is **2–3× harder/longer** than demos suggest. Budget for human‑in‑the‑loop and workflow redesign.

**Status:** All agents healthy; systems stable; Chinese New Year celebrations ongoing.
