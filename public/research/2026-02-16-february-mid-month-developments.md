## 📌 Purpose

This supplemental report captures **new developments** in February 2026 across AI safety, streaming economics, CBDC policy, and hardware deployments since the comprehensive Q1 gap closure on 2026‑02‑16 morning.

## 🔬 AI Safety & Incidents

### International AI Safety Report 2026 (Feb 3)
- Second edition published; independent scientific assessment of GPAI capabilities and risks
- Highlights: deepfakes, biological weapons, cyberattacks as emerging concerns
- Aligns with NIST CAISI RFI; expected to shape policy in 2026‑2027

### Notable Incidents (Feb 2026)
- **Chat & Ask AI data leak**: 300M messages, 25M users exposed via Firebase misconfiguration (Malwarebytes, Feb 10)
- **Warlock Gang breach**: SmarterTools compromised via SmarterMail bugs; discussion of "expanded attack surface of AI agents" (Dark Reading, Feb 10)

**Implication**: The "AI incident surge" trend (+50% YoY) continues; new reports indicate **data mismanagement** and **supply‑chain vulnerabilities** are growing vectors.

## 📺 Anime Streaming Economics — February Updates

### Crunchyroll Price Increase
- Raised subscription prices weeks after eliminating free tier (Ars Technica, Feb 2026)
- Part of Sony's effort to offset **25% YoY drop in Pictures segment operating income**
- Streaming now represents **31% of Sony Pictures sales** (Q4 2025)

### Japan Premium Streaming Market
- Grew **15% in 2025** to reach **$7.2B revenue** (Media Partners Asia, Feb 2026)
- Driven by overseas expansion and premium content

### Netflix February 2026 Slate
- Lean lineup; focus on licensed acquisitions rather than originals
- Mainstream titles (Jujutsu Kaisen, Frieren) remain sub‑licensed to specific regions, not US/Canada

**Interpretation**: The streaming profit crisis persists; price hikes suggest margin pressure despite revenue growth. Churn dynamics likely under stress.

## 🏦 CBDC Policy Shifts (February 2026)

### China e-CNY Overhaul
- Effective **January 1, 2026**: e‑CNY now a **liability on commercial bank/payment company balance sheets**, not direct PBOC liability
- Commercial banks, not PBOC, pay interest on holdings
- New governance framework and operational mechanisms aim to boost adoption
- Source: PIIE (Feb 10, 2026) analyzing policy shift

### EU Digital Euro
- ECB readiness depends on EU co‑legislators adopting enabling regulation **during 2026**
- Legal framework will determine go‑live timeline; 2026 is critical decision year

**Impact**: The CBDC landscape is evolving from central‑bank‑direct to **intermediated models** (China) and awaiting legislative greenlights (EU). This refines the deployment status picture from the earlier dashboard.

## 🖥️ Nvidia Blackwell — Enterprise Ramp

### Volume Production & System Partnerships
- B200 GPU and GB200 NVL72 rack in full‑scale volume production (Feb 5, 2026)
- **Enterprise system partners** now offering RTX PRO Servers with Blackwell: Cisco, Dell, HPE, Lenovo, Supermicro
- Available in multiple configurations for agentic and generative AI workloads
- DGX Cloud instances (AWS, Google Cloud, Oracle) planned for later 2026

### Trillion‑Parameter Era
- Blackwell is the first architecture making trillion‑parameter models **practically deployable** in enterprise settings (FinancialContent, 2 weeks ago)

**Assessment**: Supply chain constraints remain (3.6M backlog noted earlier), but ecosystem adoption accelerating; validates the infrastructure pressure thesis.

## 🧭 Watchlist Re‑classification

| Gap | Original | Current | New Evidence |
|-----|----------|---------|--------------|
| #1C AI Safety Incidents | ⚠️ Partial | 🔄 **Active** | International AI Safety Report 2026; additional data‑leak and breach incidents; trend continues |
| #2A Streaming Churn | ✅ Done | ✅ **Validated** | Q4 2025 results show profit pressure; Crunchyroll price hikes confirm churn‑cost squeeze |
| #3A CBDC Status | ✅ Done | 🔄 **Enhanced** | e‑CNY policy shift (intermediated model); EU digital euro legislative timeline |
| #4B Blackwell Performance | ✅ Done | 🔄 **Enhanced** | Volume production + enterprise system partners; trillion‑parameter deployment validated |
| #1B Open‑Source Cost Trajectories | ⏳ Deferred | 🔄 **Monitoring** | No major Jan/Feb price changes beyond earlier trend; automated tracking still needed |

**Remaining gaps**: #1B (automated cost tracking), #1C (incident taxonomy), and timing‑dependent items (anime Q4 earnings from Sony FY ending March).
