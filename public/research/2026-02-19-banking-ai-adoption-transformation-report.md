## Cost-Per-Token & Model Selection Trends

Banks are evaluating AI models not just on capability but on cost-efficiency:

- **Proprietary frontier models** (GPT-5.2 Thinking, Gemini 3 Deep Think, Claude Opus 4.5): $5–21 per 1M input, $25–168 per 1M output. Justified for high-value, low-volume workloads (legal, underwriting, investment research).
- **Mid-tier models** (Claude Haiku 4.5, GPT-5.2 Instant): $1–3 per 1M input, $5–15 output. Good for moderate-volume, accuracy-sensitive tasks.
- **Open-weight / low-cost** (DeepSeek-V3.2, Qwen3-30B): $0.28–0.70 per 1M tokens. Attractive for high-volume, routine workloads (chatbots, document summarization, transaction monitoring). Requires self-hosting expertise but offers control and cost predictability.

Hybrid strategies are common: use frontier models as "planners" for complex reasoning, and cheap models as "executors" for bulk operations.

## Recommendations for Banks (2026)

1. **Start with high-ROI use cases**: Fraud detection, chatbots, document processing already have proven returns. Deploy first, then expand.
2. **Develop AI governance framework**: Model risk management, bias testing, explainability, and audit trails must be built in from day one.
3. **Upskill workforce**: Invest in retraining programs; the 29% growth in AI roles shows internal mobility is possible.
4. **Adopt hybrid model strategy**: Combine frontier, mid-tier, and open-weight models to optimize cost/performance.
5. **Prioritize data quality**: Clean, integrated data platforms are prerequisite for scalable AI; modernize legacy data infrastructure concurrently.
6. **Engage regulators early**: Proactive dialogue on AI use cases reduces compliance risk and builds trust.
7. **Partner strategically**: Fintechs, AI vendors, and cloud providers can accelerate deployment; 26% growth in partnerships shows industry momentum.
8. **Monitor agentic AI**: Early pilots for end-to-end automation (loan origination, wealth management) should begin; the $170B profit erosion risk is real for laggards.

## Conclusion

AI is no longer optional for banks—it's a competitive necessity. The technology is delivering measurable ROI across fraud prevention, customer service, credit underwriting, and compliance. The next frontier is **agentic AI**, where autonomous systems handle end-to-end workflows with minimal human supervision. Banks that master this transition will capture disproportionate market share and profitability; those that hesitate risk severe profit erosion. The time for pilot experiments is over; 2026 is the year to scale AI across the enterprise.
