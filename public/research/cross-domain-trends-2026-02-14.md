*Source: Atlantic Council CBDC Tracker, Wikipedia*

### Regulatory & Mandate Challenges

Despite widespread interest, **71.4% of central banks lack legal mandate to issue CBDCs** (up from 69% in 2025benchmark). Only 28.6% have explicit issuance authority.

**Key Regional Developments:**

**Europe:**
- **Digital Euro:** ECB moved to preparation phase (Oct 2023); decision expected by end of 2025
- EU PQC deadlines: 2030 (deprecation), 2035 (disallowance)
- Member states to start PQC transition by end of 2026

**United States:**
- Federal Reserve researching wholesale CBDC (Project Hamilton)
- **Political opposition:** Republican Party generally against CBDC; Florida banned state payments using CBDCs (May 2023)
- Congress considering bipartisan *Quantum Encryption Readiness and Resilience Act*

**China:**
- **Digital RMB (e-CNY):** First major economy to launch; 10+ years of R&D
- Active retail pilots in multiple cities
- Programmable money features (e.g., expiration dates in Shenzhen trial: 90% of vouchers spent)

**India:**
- **Digital Rupee:** Launched 2025; wholesale and retail variants
- Central bank exploring both token-based and account-based models

### CBDC Benefits vs. Risks

**Potential Benefits:**
- Faster, cheaper real-time payments without intermediaries
- Financial inclusion (free/low-cost basic accounts at central bank)
- Reduced transaction fees (disrupting Visa/Mastercard model)
- Enhanced tax collection & anti-money laundering
- Programmable money for targeted stimulus ("helicopter money")
- Preservation of seigniorage as cash usage declines
- Alternative to fractional reserve banking for risk-averse depositors

**Major Concerns:**
- **Privacy:** "Government surveillance of personal finances" — "eagle-eyed view on spending of everyone"
- **Banking disintermediation:** Risk of bank runs if citizens move deposits to CBDC
- **Centralization:** Government can add/remove money with "flip of a switch"
- **Social control:** Potential to prohibit purchases, expire money, fine citizens automatically
- **Cybersecurity:** High-value target for state-sponsored attacks
- **Digital dollarization:** Foreign CBDCs could replace local currencies

### Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) — The Coming Storm

**Timeline & Deadlines:**
- **NIST PQC algorithms released:** March 2025 (fifth algorithm selected)
- **Deprecation:** RSA, ECDSA, EdDSA, DH, ECDH deprecated by 2030
- **Disallowance:** Completely disallowed by 2035
- **EU alignment:** Same 2030/2035 deadlines
- **"Harvest-now, decrypt-later" attacks:** Already active; adversaries collecting encrypted data today

**Enterprise Readiness (as of early 2026):**
- **91%** of businesses have NO formal PQC roadmap (Trusted Computing Group survey)
- **80%** say current crypto libraries/Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) NOT ready for PQC
- Only **30%** of large enterprises ($250M+ revenue) have conducted full cryptographic inventory
- **24%** using inventory data to guide remediation
- **97%** plan to invest 6-10% of cybersecurity budget in PQC over next 24 months

**Financial Services Leading:** Every fintech firm reportedly has PQC effort underway (Thales data)

**Key Enablers:**
- **TLS 1.3 with hybrid PQC** already available (Cloudflare: >50% of human-initiated traffic now using PQC)
- Symmetric encryption already quantum-safe (AES-256)
- New scanning tools emerging for cryptographic asset discovery
