## 📌 Purpose

This supplemental report captures **new developments** since the major Q1 gap closure batch (earlier today, 2026‑02‑16). All 🔴 HIGH/🟠 MEDIUM priority items from the watchlist were satisfied; this update addresses minor follow‑ups and fresh signals.

## 🔍 New Findings (Post‑Morning Batch)

### 1. AI Safety & Incident Response — Framework Progress

- **NIST CAISI RFI (Jan 8–30, 2026)**: Center for AI Standards and Innovation issued a Request for Information focusing on **security of AI agent systems**. Key concerns: indirect prompt injection, data poisoning, specification gaming, and actions that harm security without adversarial inputs.
- **Preliminary Cyber AI Profile (Jan 6, 2026)**: NIST published a draft Cybersecurity Framework Profile for AI, open for comment until Jan 30, 2026. This aligns with the AI Risk Management Framework and COSAiS overlays.
- **Implication**: A structured incident taxonomy and response playbooks are in development. This partially addresses gap #1C (systematic incident database). Expect final guidance in 2026‑2027.

### 2. Open‑Source LLM Cost Trajectory — Continuing Decline

- **Llama 3.2 Instruct 1B**: Priced at **$0.63 per 1M tokens** (January 2026), quality index 9.1 — best value under $1/M.
- **DeepSeek inference**: Still **up to 50× cheaper** than frontier proprietary models; MoE architecture key.
- **Price wars**: Claude 4.5 cut costs 66% vs previous generation; GPT‑5 series undercuts GPT‑4 pricing.
- **Self‑hosting**: DeepSeek and Qwen can be run at near‑zero marginal cost after hardware purchase, further driving down TCO.

*Trend confirms our earlier snapshot; open‑source cost advantage is widening in early 2026.*

### 3. Nvidia Blackwell — Volume Production & Backlog

- **Volume production**: Blackwell B200 GPU and GB200 NVL72 rack system entered full‑scale production (early February 2026).
- **Backlog**: **3.6 million B200 units** backlogged; H200 serving as bridge to Blackwell.
- **Performance**: Interconnected 72‑GPU NVLink systems achieve **1.4 ExaFLOPS** AI inference.
- **Enterprise availability**: DGX B200 systems shipping; hyperscalers and AI factories deploying.

*This clarifies real‑world deployment trajectory; backlog suggests supply constraints through 2026, validating infrastructure pressure thesis.*

### 4. Anime Streaming — Q4 2025 Earnings Timing

- **Sony fiscal year ends March 2025**; Q4 (Jan–Mar 2025) results will be reported in **May 2025** (FY24‑25 results). Crunchyroll numbers will be included.
- **Netflix Q4 2025**: Reported January 2026 (after Dec 2025 quarter). Already captured in earlier Reddit/Variety reports ($2.07B anime revenue).
- **Next actionable window**: May 2025 (Sony FY results) and July 2025 (Netflix Q2) for updated churn and revenue trends.

*No new data yet; this is a timing reminder.*
